## Protocols to Follow

### Commit Protocols

- Ensure the subject line is a maximum of 72 characters.
- Begin the subject line with a capitalized letter.
- Use the active voice (e.g., "Introduce feature" rather than "Introduced feature").
- Separate the main message and any additional details with a line.
- Mention any related issues or pull requests in the details.

### Code Consistency

For uniformity in coding, we rely on ESLint with guidelines inspired by [Airbnb's JS standards](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base). 

In addition, plugins like [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) and [Jest](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest) are incorporated for further quality control.

Please ensure your submitted code aligns with the standards we've set.
